<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld VOC Gas Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld VOC gas detector market primarily features two types: Photoionization Detectors (PID) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors. PID detectors utilize ultraviolet light to ionize gas molecules, enabling the detection of low concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with high sensitivity. In contrast, MOS sensors operate by measuring changes in electrical resistance when gas molecules adhere to a semiconductor surface, making them cost-effective yet less sensitive than PIDs. Both types are essential for industrial safety and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
