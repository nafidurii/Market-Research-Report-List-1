<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rutile TiO2 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rutile TiO2 market is primarily divided into two production processes: sulfate and chloride. The sulfate process uses sulfuric acid to extract TiO2 from ilmenite or titanium slag, producing a lower-grade pigment suitable for coatings, plastics, and paper. The chloride process, using chlorine gas and high-grade feedstock like rutile, yields a purer, high-performance TiO2 ideal for premium applications like automotive coatings and specialty plastics. Both methods cater to diverse industries, with the chloride process being more cost-effective and environmentally efficient for high-end markets.</p></p>
