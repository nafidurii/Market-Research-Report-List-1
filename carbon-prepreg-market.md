<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carbon prepreg market is divided into two main types: thermoset and thermoplastic. Thermoset prepregs are made from resin that hardens permanently when cured, offering high thermal stability and excellent mechanical properties, making them ideal for aerospace and automotive applications. In contrast, thermoplastic prepregs are made from resins that can be reheated and reshaped, providing greater flexibility, toughness, and quicker processing times. This makes thermoplastic suitable for innovative applications where recyclability and rapid production are essential.</p></p>
