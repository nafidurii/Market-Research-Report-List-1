<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray Imaging Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DR</li><li>CR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray imaging devices encompass two primary market types: Digital Radiography (DR) and Computed Radiography (CR). DR utilizes digital sensors to capture images instantly, providing higher resolution and reduced radiation exposure, ideal for real-time diagnostics. In contrast, CR employs a phosphor imaging plate that stores the X-ray data, which is then digitally processed, allowing for a more cost-effective solution but with longer processing times. Both technologies have distinct advantages suited to varying clinical needs and operational efficiencies in healthcare settings.</p></p>
