<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Draining Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Non-Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The draining pumps market features two primary types: submersible and non-submersible pumps. Submersible pumps operate underwater, efficiently removing water from deep wells or flooded areas. They are typically sealed to prevent damage from immersion. In contrast, non-submersible pumps, also known as surface pumps, are positioned above the water level and draw water through a suction pipe. These are suitable for shallow applications. Both types cater to various industries, including construction, agriculture, and municipal services, emphasizing their versatility in water management.</p></p>
